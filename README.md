A sandbox repo to learn p5.js for creative projects

## Working Through Code As a Creative Medium

[Code As a Creative Medium](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Creative-Medium-Handbook-Computational/dp/0262542048/ref=sr_1_1?crid=DVYAPBSLE31&dchild=1&keywords=golan+levin&qid=1620660304&sprefix=tokyo+dri%2Caps%2C231&sr=8-1) is a workbook and collection of exercises designed to teach visual artists how to code as well as teaching software engineers learn about visual design.

Over the next several weeks, I will be blogging through the various exercises in this excellent, thought-provoking book and blogging about it on [Medium](https://marthaller-jr.medium.com/). Follow me there to see my progress as a coder AND visual artist!
