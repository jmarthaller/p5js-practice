# Working Through Code As Creative Medium

[Code As Creative Medium](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Creative-Medium-Handbook-Computational/dp/0262542048/ref=sr_1_1?crid=DVYAPBSLE31&dchild=1&keywords=golan+levin&qid=1620660304&sprefix=tokyo+dri%2Caps%2C231&sr=8-1) is a workbook and collection of exercises written by [Golan Levin](http://www.flong.com/) and [Tega Brain](http://www.tegabrain.com/). The book is a part of an ambitious project, and aims to teach visual artists how to code as well as teaching software engineers learn about visual design.

Over the next several weeks, I will be blogging through the various exercises in this excellent, thought-provoking book and blogging about it on [Medium](https://marthaller-jr.medium.com/). Exercises very from designing a face to designing an alternative way to represent time through code. Follow me there to see my progress as a coder AND visual artist.
